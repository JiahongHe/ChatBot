This is part of our final project "Smart Wearable Device for Seniors" for course Internet of Things of Columbia University  

The core parts of this chatbot is built and trained by follwing the tutorial  
Sendex Creating a Chatbot with Deep Learning, Python, and TensorFlow: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdc2k5dwtDTyT9aCja0on8j. 

This model is built upon nmt-chatbot by Daniel Kukiela (Github: https://github.com/daniel-kukiela/nmt-chatbot).  

The model check-point is removed due to it's size (around 600MB).
To retrain, follow Sendex's tutorial with the link above.

To install the requirements for this model, open a command line prompt and  
pip install -r requirements.txt
